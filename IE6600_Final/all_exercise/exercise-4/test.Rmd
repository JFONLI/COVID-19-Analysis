## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
counties <- readRDS("www/data/counties.RDS")
counties$name %>% unique
state <- separate(counties, name, into = c("State", "County"), sep = ",")
state$State %>% unique()
?separate
white <- counties$white
white
var <- pmax(white, 0)
var <- pmin(white, 100)

percents <- as.integer(cut(var, 100, include.lowest = TRUE, ordered = TRUE))
white
percents

?map

```



```{r}
library(shiny)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
shades <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "darkgreen"))(100)

fills <- shades[percents]
fills
```

```{r}
map("county", fill = TRUE, col = fills, resolution = 0, lty =0,
    projection = "polyconic", myborder = 0, mar = c(0,0,0,0))

map("state", col = "white", fill = FALSE, add = TRUE,
    lty = 1, lwd = 1, projection = "polyconic", 
    myborder = 0, mar = c(0,0,0,0))

map("usa")
?map
```

```{r}
counties <- readRDS("www/data/counties.RDS")

```
